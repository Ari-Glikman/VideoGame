# VideoGame

This game was my final project for a Computer Graphics course. It can be expanded to be made multiplayer, but is currently just a single player version. The objective is to kill the enemies.

It is intended to simulate an OpenGL library that is hosted on 'Processing'. For smooth running, run the game on the processing app by importing the classes.

One can change the look and feel of the game using the keys: 'r' = change the view, 'b' = 2D -> 3D, 't' = add textile, 'c' = enable collisions/damage

Move with 'a','w','s','d' and shoot with space bar.
